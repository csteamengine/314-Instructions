# 314-Instructions
We created this website for an English class at Iowa State University.
I used HTML and CSS and it was my first website from scratch.

#Goal
The goal of this website is to teach people how to build multiple different types of Paper airplanes.
We decided to go above and beyond to create a website instead of a booklet because,
websites are dynamic, pretty, and much more interactive than a booklet.
